Section 08: Expressions and Statements
------------------------------------------------------------------

Expressions

An expression is:

	- The most basic building block of a program
	
	- "a sequence of operators and operands that
	  specifies a computation"

	- Computes a value from a number of operands

	- There is much, much more to expressions -
	  not necessary at this level


Expression Examples

	- 34			// literal

	- favorite_number	// variable

	- 1.5 + 2.8		// addition

	- 2 * 5			// multiplication

	- a > b			// relational

	- a = b			// assignment


Statements

A statement is:

	- A complete line of code that performs some action

	- Usually terminated with a semi-colon

	- Usually contain expressions

	- C++ has many types of statements

		+ expression, null, compound, selection,
		  iteration, declaration, jump, try blocks,
		  and others


Statement Examples

	- int x;					// declaration

	- favorite_number = 12;				// assignment

	- 1.5 + 2.8;					// expression

	- x = 2 * 5;					// assignment

	- if(a > b) cout << " a is greater than b";	// if statement
