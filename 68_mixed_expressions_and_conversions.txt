Section 08: Mixed Expressions and Conversions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mixed Type Expressions

	- C++ operations occur on same type operands

	- If operands are of different types, C++ will
	  convert one

	- Important! since it could affect calculation
	  results

	- C++ will attempt to automatically convert 
	  types (coercion)
	
		+ if it can't, a compiler error will
		  occur


Conversions

	- Higher vs Lower types are based on the size
	  of the values the type can hold

		+ long double, double, float, unsigned
		  long, long, unsigned int, int

		+ short, and char types are always
		  converted to int

	- Type Coercion: conversion of one operand to
	  another data type

	- Promotion: conversion to a higher type

		+ used in mathematical expressions
		
	- Demotion: conversion to a lower type

		+ used with assignment to lower type


Explicit Type Casting - static_cast<type>

	int total_amount {100};
	int total_number {8};
	double average {0.0};

	average = total_amount / total_number;
	cout << average << endl;	// displays 12

	average = static_cast<double>(total_amount) / total_number;
	cout << average << endl;	// displays 12.5
